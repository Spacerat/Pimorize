Pimorize: By Joseph 'Spacerat' Atkins-Turkish.

Pimorize is based on a game created in Gamemaker which I played a long time ago, and which is responsible for the 30 digits of pi I still know today. This remake is designed to be more flexible in a number of ways, including window-scalability, the ability to work with any number, and changable sounds.
